====================================
Image SIG - a oneAPI Community Forum
====================================

Introduction
============

The Image SIG hosts discussions and presentations for fundamental image processing routines for high-performance
computing, engineering, financial, and other applications.

This SIG discusses the oneAPI Image Processing Library (oneIPL) in the planning and spec development stage. Its goal is
to become an extensive library of ready-to-use, highly optimized image processing functions. As part of oneAPI, oneIPL
is designed to allow execution on various computational devices: CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. The functionality
is subdivided into several domains: filers, geometry transformations, and color and type conversions.

Its royalty-free APIs help developers:

1. Use vectorization and SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) instructions on CPU and GPU.

2. Use CPU threading and GPU SIMT (single instruction, multiple threads).

3. Improve the performance of computation-intensive applications with pipelines involving image processing and other
   operations provided as DPC++ kernel or oneAPI libraries.

In addition to domain-specific functionality, the Image SIG may also discuss overall design features like the execution
model, memory model, or error handling. At times, the open source oneIPL Interfaces project, which implements the oneIPL
specification may also be discussed.

Purpose of the Group
====================

The Image Special Interest Group (Image SIG) is committed to the collaborative development, understanding, and promotion
of the open standard oneIPL. We aim to build a comprehensive image-processing library to set a new standard for image
processing in the oneAPI ecosystem.

1. Collaborate: Gather key industry stakeholders to contribute to the oneIPL standard. Engineers and software developers
   from across the industry will share insights, knowledge, and resources to collaboratively shape the future of the
   oneIPL specification.

2. Innovate: Encourage innovative thinking and problem-solving to advance the future of image processing within the
   oneAPI ecosystem.

3. Educate: Share experiences and best practices related to oneIPL with the wider oneAPI community.

Strategy for Achieving Goals
============================

To achieve these goals, the following strategic approach will be taken:

1. Community Building: Foster a vibrant and active community of engineers and software developers that meets regularly
   to discuss, debate, and determine the direction of oneIPL. This will be achieved through online events and a clear
   communication channel for group members.

2. Open Collaboration: Promote an open-source mindset to enable active contributions from all members. The group will
   focus on collaboration, maintaining a transparent process where all members have access to resources and are
   encouraged to provide input on development.

3. Training and Education: Organize training sessions, workshops, and webinars to educate members and the broader oneAPI
   ecosystem about the features, advantages, and potential of the oneIPL library. This will also be an opportunity to
   gather feedback and requirements from end users.

4. Regular Updates and Reviews: Schedule periodic meetings for group members to share their experiences, progress, and
   challenges with the oneIPL library. These sessions will act as a platform for knowledge sharing, brainstorming
   solutions, and shaping the roadmap for the future of the oneIPL specification.

5. Integration with the oneAPI Ecosystem: Work closely with the broader oneAPI community to ensure the oneIPL library
   seamlessly integrates with the other elements of the oneAPI ecosystem. This will help ensure the standard is
   accessible, beneficial, and valuable to the community.

Through this purpose and strategic approach, the Image Special Interest Group will shape the future of image processing
via the oneIPL image processing library in alignment with the broader goals of the oneAPI ecosystem. We believe in the
power of collaborative innovation to drive the future of image processing and look forward to contributing to this
journey.
